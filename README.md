# Power Set Generator

This Python program takes a set as input from the user, generates the power set, and displays it. 
Test cases are included to demonstrate functionality.

## Features

- Takes user input to create a set.
- Generates the power set of the input set.
- Displays the power set in a consistent and predictable order.
- Includes programmatic test cases to validate functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo or download the script.
2. Run using Python 3.x.
3. Follow prompts to enter elements of a set separated by spaces.

### Running the Program

```
python3 power-set.py
```

## Testing

The program includes several test cases to validate its functionality. The test cases cover both normal and edge cases.

### Running Tests

Test cases are executed automatically when the script is run. If all test cases pass, the program will then prompt for user input.
